Modular Documentation
=====================

## What it is?

This repository contains modular documentation for SUSE products. 
The documentation consists of smaller information units with the following characteristics:


* Self-contained:
 
  Including requirements, context, instructions, and FAQs. 
  Each information unit is supposed to stand for itself.

* Cover one distinct purpose:

  Rather than covering a complete technology or a set of problems, each information unit covers only one distinct topic. 
  We provide three different types of information units: 
   * Task (how to?)
   * Concept (what is?)
   * Reference (e.g. list of options, table with config files, default settings)

* For re-use in different contexts:

  Every information units stands for itself, but it can be bundled into
  collections that cover different products/solutions.
