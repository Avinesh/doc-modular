# Templates for Doc Evolution

We provide three different types of information units:

* `task.xml`: Task (how to?)
* `concept.xml`: Concept (what is?)
* `reference.xml`: Reference (e.g. list of options, table with config files, default settings)

To use them, copy them from this directory to `xml/`.
